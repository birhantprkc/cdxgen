 * Canonicalise the distro vendor namespace of an OS package component

 * pkg:rpm/cbl-mariner/... -> pkg:rpm/azure-linux/... so the purls match the
 * vulnerability feeds. Also aligns the ``distro`` qualifier vendor prefix
 * (alma-9.8 -> almalinux-9.8, mariner-2.0 -> azure-linux-2.0), including
 * spellings that disagree with the namespace, and rebuilds ``group`` and
 * ``bom-ref`` from the rewritten purl.
 *
 * The namespace table is OS_NAMESPACE_ALIAS from lib/inventory/osinfo.js so
 * the trivy path and the os-release path (getDistroInfo) cannot drift apart.
 *
 * A `distro` qualifier that is not purl-safe (trivy emits Amazon Linux as

 * derived value, or dropped when there is none: an unusable qualifier

 * with `tags: ["source"]` and identity confidence 0, the very marker the
 * shadow carries so consumers can filter shadows out. That turns a real
 * package into a filtered-away one.
