/**
 * cdxrs — JS bridge to the Rust-native CycloneDX BOM tooling binary.
 *
 * This module is the ONLY place that spawns the `cdxrs` binary. It enforces
 * the governing invariant: **no failure mode may abort SBOM generation.**
 * Every failure (missing binary, non-zero exit, timeout, malformed stdout,
 * version-major mismatch, CDXGEN_RS_DISABLE) logs once at `warn` and returns
 * a sentinel that makes the caller take the JS path.
 *
 * Protocol:
 *   cdxrs <subcommand> --input <file|-> --output <file|-> --format json
 *   stdin/stdout carry JSON; stderr carries newline-delimited JSON log records.
 *   Exit codes: 0 ok, 1 operational failure, 2 bad usage, 3 validation findings.
 *
 * See docs/CDXRS_PROTOCOL.md for the full specification.

 * Pass BOM data one of two ways:
 *   - `content`: an in-memory string/Buffer, fed to the child over stdin with
 *     `--input -`. Content larger than 32 MB is spilled to a temp file and
 *     passed by path instead, per the protocol; the file is always removed.
 *   - `input`: a path to a file already on disk.
 *
 * Passing `content` is the normal case, since cdxgen holds BOMs in memory.
 *
 * @param {string} subcommand The subcommand to run (e.g. "info").
 * @param {Object} opts
 * @param {string|Buffer} [opts.content] BOM data to feed over stdin.
 * @param {string} [opts.input] Input file path. Defaults to "-" (stdin), which
 *   requires `content`.
 * @param {string[]} [opts.args] Extra arguments to pass.
 * @param {number} [opts.timeoutMs] Timeout in milliseconds.
 * @returns {Promise<{ok: boolean, stdout: string, exitCode: number|null, reason?: string}>}
