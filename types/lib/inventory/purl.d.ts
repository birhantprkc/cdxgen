 * segment of a Package URL is not restricted by the spec. What distinguishes a
 * *registered* type is that cdx-purl ships a rule table for it
 * (`TYPE_RULES_SOURCE`, exposed as `TypedPurls`) — namespace requirements,
 * permitted qualifiers, and so on. A purl built with an unregistered type
 * round-trips but gets no type-specific normalization, and more importantly it
 * identifies a package in a namespace no vulnerability database or advisory
 * feed recognises.
 *
 * Ecosystems cdxgen supports that have no registered type (nix, zig, mojo, and
 * gleam when it is not published via hex) must therefore emit `pkg:generic/...`
 * with a `cdx:purl:proposedType` property instead of squatting a type. This set
 * is the single source of truth for that decision, sourced directly from
